#Part 1: Introduction and Setting Up the Basics

To understand PHP and MySQL, you must start from the basics and work your way up to more complex topics. A great way to learn the fundamentals is to build something of your own. This tutorial will take you through all the steps necessary to build your own forum.Forums were one of the first types of websites created on the internet. They allowed users from all over the world to share ideas and information. They are also fairly basic to implement and show you many of the basic ways to use PHP and MySQL to produce a dynamic website.
	
This tutorial assumes that you have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS (if you would like to learn more about these and other front-end web development languages,

In order to run the code in this tutorial, you will need the following:

- A development environment or server with PHP installed
	- There are several tools that help you setup a development environment on your personal computer so you can test code. The following are the most popular at this time:
		- [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) 
		- [Wamp Server](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
		- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

- MySQL installed in your development environment or server
	- If you need more help installing MySQL, consult the relevant [MySQL Documentation](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/).
	- I will walk you through creating the database and tables, you just need to make sure MySQL is installed

Once you have set up a working development environment that has PHP and MySQL installed, you are ready to get started creating your own forum.
